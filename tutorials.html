  <div id="tutorial"><h2>Beginner Guide</h2>
 	<p>In this guide, we will walk you through the first stages of building your Hearthstone account. Unlike most other games, Hearthstone does not allow you to reset your account, meaning that you could potentially make mistakes that will set you back considerably. This guide applies mainly to those players who do not wish to (at least initially) invest a lot of real money into Hearthstone, since it focuses on maximising the benefit of the resources you gain from playing the game. If you plan on spending money to buy many packs of cards, then the advice we give here is mostly irrelevant to your situation.

If you have not yet played Hearthstone, or if you are simply interested in very general information about the game, we advise you to read our introduction to Hearthstone. If you are looking to get a better understanding of the gameplay mechanics, we advise you to read our Hearthstone mechanics guide.</p>
<h2>1. Tutorial</h2>
	<p>This article is not a gameplay guide, and it assumes that you have completed the tutorial, which means that you should be familiar, at least on a very basic level, with how the game functions (for example, how to play a card from your hand, how Mana Crystals work, and so on).

After completing the tutorial, you will finally have access to the game's main menu, depicted below.</p>
  <img src="images/tutorialimg.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt=""/> 
  <p>As you can see, there are a number of buttons available for you to click. We will briefly explain what each one does.

Store allows you to purchase packs of cards (that go to your card collection) using in-game gold or real money.
Quest Log allows you to see your quest progress, the levels of all your classes, as well as statistics showing how many games you have won, and what your best Arena performance has been.
My Collection allows you to check your card collection, build new decks, and to disenchant and craft cards.
Play allows you to engage in (ranked or unranked) games against human opponents.
Practice allows you to engage in games against the AI. This is also where you will be playing at first in order to unlock all 9 classes.
Arena allows you to play using a deck made up of random cards, which do not take your card collection into account.
Chat allows you to monitor the status of your Battle.net friends, as well as to challenge friends to duel in Hearthstone.
Options allows you to change a few graphics and sound settings, as well as to view the game cinematic and credits.</p>
